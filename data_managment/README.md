This directory contains the sripts that were used to manage the data

* from the RAVDESS database
* from the MELD database
* as well as the script which made it possible to merge the two databases

Indeed, the classification approach consisted of training the models on the RAVDESS data, then merging the two databases for the generalizability of the models.
